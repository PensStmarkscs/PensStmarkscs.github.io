<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #808080;">This website is mainly towards selling, buying and trading pens from different people in-person in the school itself, as of now there may be a small amount of offers since the website first launched on 7/3/17 and therefore the members are slowly growing, or not at all. Designed by Matt, and co-owned by&nbsp;Craig.</span></h2>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #808080;">When offering a pen for a different pen, or buying a pen, or selling a pen, you must own any kind of email manager (gmail, yahoo, etc), when complete, send an offer&nbsp;application to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:mattp222@vtxmail.us ">mattp222@vtxmail.us </a>and please state your price of your pen(s) and include a picture or add a message to the offer if you'd like, or what pen you'd like to swap for the pen you're selling/or own actual money (only accepted in&nbsp;&euro;euros.)</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #808080;">When your application has been accepted the website itself will be updated over 10 minutes or more, regarding to the owner's connection, and therefore it'd show up on "offers" section, stating the price of the pen or add a message if you want, or a money trade and much more that you'd like to include in your offer.</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #808080;">When you'd like to buy an offer please send an email towards the owner's email which it listed and include your full name which allows the owner of the offer to identify you, or add a time and the area of the school to meet and don't write down your full name.</span></h2>
